Welcome to Achoo. We want you to skip 
the minute clinic and come to us. By
typing your symptoms into our program
we will be able to easily diagnose you.

You fill find three directories in this 
folder. 

	The first folder labeled “Achoo” 
	contains the source code for this 
	project.Feel free to take a look 
	and contribute to it.

	The second folder is labeled “Final 
	Build”. This folder contains the 
	final project. Just double click on 
	the “Achoo” and the program will run.
	
	The third folder is labeled 
	“Scraper”. This folder contains the 
	python script that gets the disease 	
	information from MayoClinic.
	
	The last folder “Documentation” 
	contains some basic documentation 
	explaining how this program works.

How to use the program:

	1) Type in the the directory of the 
	diseases.txt file. Please note that
	all ‘/‘ should be replaced with ‘//‘
	2) Type in s to search with symptoms
	3) Type in your first symptom
		-try to be a bit specific and
		use anatomical terms (stomach) 
		instead	of something like 
		“tummy”
		-ex: “I have a fever”
	4) Depending on the first symptom you 
	might be asked to type in more 
	symptoms, be presented with a 	
	diagnosis or told that no diseases 
	were found with that 	symptom.
		4.1) You can narrow down your 
		diagnosis by either typing in
		more symptoms or choosing a 
		diagnosis by looking at diseases
		with similar symptoms to yours.	
	

Some general tips:

	- The “final build” will only run on
 	a mac due to the fact that it was 	
	built on a mac. However, you can 
	rebuild the program yourself using
	windows and the source code provided
	easily.
	-When the final build asks you for a 
	directory please escape the ‘/‘ 
	with an ‘//’

FINALLY, THIS DOES NOT REPLACE A DOCTOR 
VISIT. SELF DIAGNOSING IS NEVER A GOOD 
IDEA.
