Welcome to Achoo. We want you to skip 
the minute clinic and come to us. By
typing your symptoms into our program
we will be able to easily diagnose you.

You fill find three directories in this 
folder. 

	The first folder labeled “Achoo” 
	contains the source code for this 
	project.Feel free to take a look and 
	contribute to it.

	The second folder is labeled “Final 
	Build”. This folder contains the 
	final project. Just double click on 
	the “Achoo” and the program will run.
	
	The third folder is labeled “Scraper”.	
	This folder contains the python script 
	that gets the disease information from 
	MayoClinic.
	
	The last folder “Documentation” contains 
	some basic documentation explaining how 
	this program works.


Some general tips:

	- The “final build” will only run on a mac
	  due to the fact that it was built on a 
	  mac. However, you can rebuild the program
	  yourself using windows and the source code
	  provided easily.
	- When the final build asks you for a directory
	  please escape the ‘/‘ with an ‘//’

FINALLY, THIS DOES NOT REPLACE A DOCTOR VISIT. 
SELF DIAGNOSING IS NEVER A GOOD IDEA.
